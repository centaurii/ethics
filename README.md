Centaurii Open Source Code of Ethics

Orginally created on October 12, 2014 by Gautam Narula and Andrew Schuster

Version 0.9

INTRODUCTION

The Centaurii Code of Ethics (CoE) is an open source document outlining the ethics guidelines that Centaurii
holds itself to. We decided to make this document open source for three reasons:

1) It makes us more accountable when third parties can monitor our compliance to the CoE
2) It can help and inspire other organizations to create their own codes of ethics
3) We can take the best input from the open source community and incorporate into the CoE via pull requests

Our goal with this document is to lay out a clear, concise ethical framework that governs our operations. 
We strongly believe that a companies can and should make the world a better place, and this document 
was created with that in mind. While many parts of the CoE may not be able to be implemented immediately,
it serves as a set of guidelines for making future decisions. 

The CoE is organized into four areas based on the quadruple bottom line: People, Planet, Profit, and Purpose 

PEOPLE

People should be viewed as an end in and of themselves, rather than a means to an end (i.e, a means to making money). 
We recognize three classes of people affected by our operations: employees, customers, and the population at large. 

	a) Employees
	
	- Create a work environment that is welcoming of all employees regardless of age, sex, orientation, race, religion,
	and nationality.
	- Create a meritocratic environment where employees are rewarded based on talent and effort.
	- Provide compensation that is at least equal to market rate, if not more.
	- Create an environment where employees have input into how the company is run and what it works on.
	- Encourage employees to develop physically (healthcare, gym access, standing desks, healthy meals, etc.) and mentally (book stipends,
	conference funds, personal project time).
	
	b) Customers
	- Be cognizant of the fact that all the work we do affects our customers. 
	- Provide excellent customer service by responding quickly, listening and acting on customer feedback, and going above and beyond to
	make things right when we mess up.
	
	c) Population at large
	- Avoid participation in industries that negatively impact society at large (i.e making cigarettes).
	- Avoid using resources to affect policies that will negatively impact society at large, even if they benefit Centaurii.
	

PLANET

We seek not only to minimize the our impact on the environment, but to actually create a net improvement its condition.
 
	- Actively take steps to reduce our carbon footprint, with the goal of eventually having a negative carbon footprint.
	- Encourage employees to use environmentally friendly forms of transporation (provide bus fare, locate near mass transit, bike friendly)
	- Undertake environmentally beneficial projects.
	- Factor in the environmental costs of starting any new project.
	
PROFIT

To survive, businesses must make a profit. However, we want to make the money the right way. 

	- Make money to build things. Don't build things to make money. 
	- Don't make money by seriously contradicting any of the other parts of this document.

PURPOSE

This section outlines Centaurii's underlying philosophy in everything it does.

	- Build things that make the world a better place.
	- Be transparent and honest when we screw up. Publicly acknowledge mistakes rather than trying to cover them up.
	- Contribute to the community via open source projects and volunteer work.
	- Be honest. Don't lie to people. 
	- Don't be evil isn't enough. Be good.
